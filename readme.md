Oil extraction

A company in the oil extraction business wants to create a new digital system.
The first requirement is about management of the actual oil extractors. 
All extractors have a serial number, an intended capacity (how much they are capable of extracting in 24 hours) and a quantity (how much they actually extracted in 24 hours).
Additionally, some extractors can report if they had any faults in the last 24 hours.
There are multiple types of extractors:
Fixed terrestrial extractors are installed in a location that cannot change after it has been initially set. 
They cannot report faults.
Mobile terrestrial extractors can change the location after it was set. 
They report a fault if the daily extracted quantity is below 25% of the capacity.
Offshore platforms are installed at sea (they have no location) and have a list of essential workers.
A worker has a name, a position (manual worker, medic or manager), and the number of days they have been on the platform.
All platforms report a fault if they extracted less than 70% of the indented capacity, don't have a medic, or any of the workers has been on board for more than 14 days.
The business is interested a couple of important reports:
What is the number of devices with faults?
What are all the devices that have extracted more than 95% of their capacity in the last 24 hours?
